# GDP-per-Capita-

Project overview

This project analyses global GDP per capita (a standard measure of average economic output per person) to compare countries, reveal temporal trends, and highlight regional patterns and inequality. The main deliverable is an interactive Tableau workbook (.twbx) that maps GDP per capita and shows trends across years.

Files in this repo

GDP Per Capita.xlsx — the dataset used for analysis (raw Excel file).

GDP per Capita of the World.twbx — Tableau packaged workbook containing the dashboards and data extract.

README.md — this file.

Dataset & provenance

Current status: the dataset file (GDP Per Capita.xlsx) is included in this repository.

Suggested format:

Source: World Bank — GDP per capita (current US$) — https://data.worldbank.org/ (or the actual source you used)

Years covered: e.g. 1960–2024 (update with exact years present)

Notes: units (current US$, constant US$, PPP), any currency conversions performed, and whether population was used to compute per-capita figures.

What I built (dashboards & visuals)

A typical Tableau project built from a GDP per capita dataset usually contains the following visual elements — you can update the list to match what you created in the .twbx:

World choropleth map showing GDP per capita by country for a selected year.

Time-series view showing GDP per capita trends for selected countries.

Top / bottom N country bar charts for selected year(s).

Regional aggregation and comparisons (average/median GDP per capita by region).

Small multiples or time-lapse animation to show changes over time.

Filters: year slider, region selector, country search.

How to view & reproduce
